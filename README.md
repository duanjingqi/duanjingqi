Hello, I am Jingqi Duan. Welcome to my github. 

I am a structural biologist 🧑‍🔬 of 10+ academic years research experience with major interest in RNA-protein complexes and their related human diseases. In academy, I was appealed to machine learning💻 and thrilled to the enormous applications of machine learning in life science research🔬. Therefore, I attended UCSD Machine Learning Engineering Bootcamp and completed it in 2023 🎉. Acquainted with ML knowledge, my exploration of ML application in biological research has just began. I have personal interests in computer vision in microscope images or medical tests, and ML in detection of disease-related patterns from RNAseq dataset. 

This space contains scripts I developed for cryoEM image processing, DNA/RNA sequence analysis, microscope image processing, and my capstone project in the UCSD bootcamp. While it displayed my capabilities, I mainly want to alluring collaborations, the essence of the github design. 

I can be reached via 📧 duanjingqi@gmail.com. Any question or comment is appreciated.
