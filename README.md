Hey, my friend! This is **Jingqi Duan**. I am a scientist⚛️ of great interests in RNA-protein complexes🧬 , mRNA splicing and its regulation🧬, ribonucleoprotein complexes🧬, autism🧒, neuron degenerative diseases🔬, etc. I determined 3D structures of H/ACA ribonucleoprotein complexes,  



and got attracted to machine learning after using deep learning algorithms cryoYOLO, a computer vision program to detect samples in cryoEM image, and AlphaFold2, a program to predict 3D structures of proteins or protein complexes based on their amino acid sequences. So, I attended UCSD Machine Learning Engineering Bootcamp and completed it in 2023.
In the bootcamp, I developed a computer vision program named Cell Segger as my capstone project. Cell Segger uses a pre-trained UNet (a Convolutional Neural Network) model to process cell microscope images and generate cell masks binary images.
