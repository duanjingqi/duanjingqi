Hello, I am Jingqi Duan. Welcome to my github. 

I am a structural biologist of 10+ academic years research experience with major interest in RNA-protein complexes and their related human diseases. In academy, I was appealed to machine learningðŸ’» and thrilled to the enormous applications of machine learning in life science researchðŸ”¬. Therefore, I attended UCSD Machine Learning Engineering Bootcamp and completed it in 2023ðŸŽ†.

This space contains scripts I developed for cryoEM image processing, DNA/RNA sequence analysis, microscope image processing, and my capstone project in the UCSD bootcamp.
